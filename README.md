# Mapping_Earthquakes

The objective of this repository is to create an interactive map containing a visualization of the tectonic plates, earthquakes and major earthquakes around the world. 

The result is a world map powered by our API, then we used the functionally of Mapbox to provide 3 different map customizations in a controller. Further more, we sourced our data from the USGS Earthquake Hazard Program using geoJSON files and added to our controller. To finalize, we created a legend holding the information of the customizations made to the markers, where the colour and size of the market is correlated  to the magnitude of the earthquake.
